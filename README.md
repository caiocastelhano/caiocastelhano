## üíª About Me

Front-end developer with hands-on experience delivering real-world projects as a freelancer. I build modern, responsive, and accessible websites, focusing on performance, custom visual identity, and best development practices.

I work with React, Next.js, JavaScript (ES6+), HTML5, CSS3, Git/GitHub, Vercel, Netlify, and CSS Modules ‚Äî always mindful of accessibility and SEO.

Before transitioning to tech, I spent over 10 years in digital marketing, content, and social media. I also have a background in film direction and philosophy ‚Äî experiences that enrich my work with an analytical, creative, and strategic perspective.
