## 💻 About Me

Full-stack developer with hands-on experience building real-world projects using Ruby on Rails, React, and Next.js — from backend logic and APIs to responsive, accessible front-end interfaces.

Currently a Teacher Assistant at Le Wagon, where I help students strengthen their foundations in Ruby, Rails, and JavaScript while reinforcing my own technical and mentoring skills.

Before transitioning to tech, I spent over 10 years working in digital marketing and content strategy, a background that helps me approach development with creativity, clarity, and strategic thinking.
